# Text_Editor

Text editor made using C. Very useful project that helped me understand how terminals work.

## Launching the Text Editor

Compiling Code:
1. Clone the repository and enter the directory in command line/Terminal.
2. Enter `make` to compile the code.

Using the text editor:
- Edit an already existing file: Enter `./texto <filepath>`
- Create a new file: Enter `./texto`. You will be prompted when saving to name the file.
